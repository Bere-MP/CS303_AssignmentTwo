Instructions:

This is a program that tests out linked list and classes. 

Linked list is test by altering the code within the main cpp file. It will test out each function defined in the Single_Linked_list cpp and header file. It will test out push_front, push_back, front, back, empty, insert, remove, and find. Push_front would push item to the front of the list. Push_back would push the item to the back of the list. Front will return first item on the list. Back will return item at the end of the list. Insert will insert item, remove will remove item. Both function will need an index input. Empty will check if list is empty and find will use index user input to find item. 

The class file is tested out by also altering the code within the main cpp file. By defining a class defined object with it's information, it will display the information on the output screen. Each inheritied class will calculate salary, health contribution, and vacation days and will save name of the employee. All this information will be displayed using print function. 

All test should be displayed in the output screen.
